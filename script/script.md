Hi all, My name's Chris and I'll be presenting on behalf of the Clinical Bioinformatics Unit.

##  2. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

This is our team. 

From left to right..

Our fearless leader, Dr Simon Sadedin and then the rest of us... the 3 bioinformaticians, Damien, Macgregor and myself.

##  3. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

What do we do? As the Clinicians Bioinformaticians in VCGS, we generally are glued to our screens, coding applications and producing data that is used within our diagnostic services.
Here is an actual screenshot of our team in a recent zoom call.

It's been a long year. Or a short one? Time is confusing. But looking at this timeline, it's interesting to see how quickly and effectively we all transitioned from working on site to working from home and for the most part it's been Business as Usual.

##  5. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

CBU has been hard at work on many things. 
From supporting Genomic data analysis for our services,
to 
increasing our efficiencies in our workflows
to
automation and integration with Gitlab and LIMS
to creating new pipelines such as the Mitochondrial Pieline...
These are some of the things we've been working hard on...

To quote Simon..."One of the most important things weâ€™ve done has been getting MM live, with much of the scale up happening during COVID.
A big part of that has been that the bioinformatic implementation really held up well in the end."

##  7. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

I then asked my team what they've been grateful for during this covid period.

Damiens been grateful for coffee takeaways, giving him that much needed caffenine boost, which is something we can all relate to. It's also been an opportunity to support local businesses.

##  8. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

Working from home I have discovered some facts about MY coffee consumption. 
If you take a look at my breakdown...
Buying 2 cups of coffee a day can get a little pricey...
But I have a solution: Home made coffee...
With this strategy i'll be saving lots of money!

##  9. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

I asked myself what I"ve been grateful for during this period

##  10. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next
I have been grateful to be constantly learn new things in this field 

##  11. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

with the assistance of my much loved feline companion...

##  12. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

Macgregor, has been grateful for the increased work flexibility, which has relieved his aching back problem.
He has also acquired new tennis playing skills.

##  13. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

This graph, while completely nonsensical, shows level of tennis skill vs back issues during this short period. 

##  14. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

Finally, Simon has been grateful that  our team really responded well to moving remote.

And has said: "Despite it being pretty tough for some of us, everyone held up and really kept up the work, doing what needed to be done to keep things running"

##  15. <a name='Next-1'></a>Next

And to that I extend this to everyone at VCGS.

Good job all 

and

Thanks
